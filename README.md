 # PostgreSQL Course: Scripts for Practice and Learning

This repository contains a collection of small to medium-sized scripts created for a PostgreSQL course. Each script is designed to illustrate key database concepts, covering everything from basic SQL queries to advanced data manipulation techniques. The scripts are organized by topic, and each file includes comments for easy understanding and reuse.

Contents:

    Data Definition Language (DDL): Scripts for creating and managing tables, indexes, and other schema objects.
    Data Manipulation Language (DML): Examples of INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and SELECT queries.
    Transactions and Concurrency Control: Demonstrations of transaction management, isolation levels, and locking.
    Functions and Stored Procedures: Basic stored procedures and user-defined functions in PL/pgSQL.
    Performance Tuning: Scripts for indexing, query optimization, and performance analysis.
    Advanced Queries: Joins, subqueries, window functions, and Common Table Expressions (CTEs).

Getting Started: To run these scripts, you need a PostgreSQL environment. Simply clone this repository and execute each script in your preferred SQL client (e.g., pgAdmin, psql).

Purpose: This repository serves as a hands-on guide for learning PostgreSQL. Whether you're a beginner or looking to deepen your database skills, these scripts are crafted to help you practice and apply what you learn in real-world scenarios.
